# Udacity FEND Portfolio Project

## Project Description

This portfolio page was created based on Udacity rubrics (link: https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/45/view).
It was reviewed by an expert Udacity reviewer.

## Page Structure

The page is created as a mobile-first, responsive layout. It contains the following elements:
* Navbar Header
    *Logo, name and social media icons
* Main image
    * Changes size depending on screen
* `<h1>` & `<p>` elements
* 4 tiles (B&W images) for projects
* On desktop-sized screens, a margin appears to the left and right to frame the page and the tiles are double the size

I adhered to a very simple top-down approach. On the largest screens, a margin on the left and right gives
the user a bit of breathing room.

## Breakpoints

The following changes happen at breakpoints:

* Mobile (up to 450px)
    * The name in the navbar is slightly smaller

* Tablets (451px to 750px)
    * The name in the navbar gets a bit bigger, and does the other text. Padding changes a little.

* Desktops (750px+)
    * Some padding is added to the sides, and text grows a bit.

## Image Rights

The images either, were created by me or were sourced from places like pexels.com, which falls under a
CC0 License and does not require attribution, though I've added the sources anyway.
I scaled down and cropped the full-size images so they were square.

## Future Plans

Because this project just required a responsive mock-up, none of the elements (except the icons) do anything,
they're just static. Eventually I would like to implement some neat hover effects over the tiles
(sadly I can't do that at this stage without copying code) and, of course, various relevant
pages will be linked.
